Neovim does not support built-in autocompletion. As mentioned in the readme, you can bind the completion results to omnifunc for on-demand completion. To use autocompletion, please use an external plugin. We can recommend the following:

* [completion-nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim)
* [nvim-compe](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-compe)
